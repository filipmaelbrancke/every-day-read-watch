# *Almost* every single day I read or watch something interesting

Inspired by [the list of Stéphane Derosiaux](https://github.com/sderosiaux/every-single-day-i-tldr), here I list all the articles, blog posts, pages I've read, or videos I've watched, that I found interesting.

I'm reading mostly about Kotlin, Scala, Data Engineering, Java, Kafka, Big Data, DDD, and technology. :muscle:

> Note: this is stuff I'm reading mostly off work of course. :see_no_evil:
