# *Almost* every single day I read or watch something interesting

Inspired by [the list of Stéphane Derosiaux](https://github.com/sderosiaux/every-single-day-i-tldr), here I list all the articles, blog posts, pages I've read, or videos I've watched, that I found interesting.

I'm reading mostly about Kotlin, Kafka, Scala, Java, Big Data Engineering, DDD, and guitar/music/audio stuff. :nerd_face:

> Note: this is stuff I'm reading mostly off work of course. :see_no_evil: My current tech stack @ work is Kotlin, Java, Kafka, Spring, Reactor

- Online Event Processing: Achieving consistency where distributed transactions have failed.  
  (Martin Kleppmann, Alastair R. Beresford, and Boerge Svingen).   
  Different way of building systems... besides Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), we should think about OLEP, which is taking transaction processing ideas and implementing them on top of event processing systems.    
  Use event logs, rather than transactions, as the primary application programming model for data management. Traditional databases are still used, but their writes come from a log rather than directly from the application.

- Ben Stopford on Microservices and Event Streaming.   
  Microservices are pretty ubiquitous these days. Really “SOA done right,” they reimagine the services pattern in the context of the world we live in today, nearly two decades since the first big service-oriented systems hit production. But what have we learned in this time?    
  Ben Stopford explore the event-driven paradigm and how it relates to the microservice architectures we build today. Ben dives deep into coupling, evolution and challenges of our increasingly data-oriented culture. He also talks about the future, where data are events and events are data, and touches on real-time architectures that retain the decoupling properties needed to be pluggable, and to evolve.
