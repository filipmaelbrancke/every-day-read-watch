# *Almost* every single day I read or watch something interesting

Inspired by [the list of Stéphane Derosiaux](https://github.com/sderosiaux/every-single-day-i-tldr), here I list all the articles, blog posts, pages I've read, or videos I've watched, that I found interesting.

I'm reading mostly about Kotlin, Kafka, Scala, Java, Big Data Engineering, DDD, and guitar/music/audio stuff. :nerd_face:

> Note: this is stuff I'm reading mostly off work of course. :see_no_evil: My current tech stack @ work is Kotlin, Java, Kafka, Spring, Reactor
