# *Almost* every single day I read or watch something interesting

Inspired by [the list of Stéphane Derosiaux](https://github.com/sderosiaux/every-single-day-i-tldr), here I list all the articles, blog posts, pages I've read, or videos I've watched, that I found interesting.

I'm reading mostly about Kotlin, Kafka, Scala, Java, Big Data Engineering, DDD, and guitar/music/audio stuff. :nerd_face:

> Note: this is stuff I'm reading mostly off work of course. :see_no_evil: My current tech stack @ work is Kotlin, Java, Kafka, Spring, Reactor

  "If the essential complexity is inherent, then you can't reduce the size of it. The only way to decrease the overall complexity is to reduce the accidental complexity.    
  There's no magical solution that will solve all problems with software development, but that doesn't mean that improvements can't be had."    
  Mark Seemann suggests to try to use better tools, from statically typed functional programming, to reduce the massive amounts of accidental complexity we still have.

How To Serve Machine Learning Models With Dynamically Controlled Streams in Cloud-Native Applications.    
https://www.lightbend.com/blog/serve-machine-learning-models-dynamically-controlled-streams    
All of the modern stream processing frameworks and engines, including [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/?_ga=2.87837720.1080481679.1564347590-1164336498.1511962281), [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/), [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/), and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (frameworks discussed further) can be used for implementing dynamically controlled streams. 
The Lightbend Platform supports the integration with these various streaming engines.     
Four examples implemented:

  Somewhat similar architecture to the solution [@mikeseghers]( https://twitter.com/mikeseghers ) and I were exploring at a previous job (https://speakerdeck.com/filipmaelbrancke/common-mobile-architecture?slide=39). Nowadays I think I would rather look into eventually-consistent databases, or GraphQL, with a client that optimistically updates a client-side cache. The article very much feels like describing the client component of an eventually-consistent data store, but without touching the nitty-gritty details of causal consistency, vector clocks, etc...

  (Martin Kleppmann, Alastair R. Beresford, and Boerge Svingen).   
  Different way of building systems... besides Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), we should think about OLEP, which is taking transaction processing ideas and implementing them on top of event processing systems.    
  Use event logs, rather than transactions, as the primary application programming model for data management. Traditional databases are still used, but their writes come from a log rather than directly from the application.

- Ben Stopford on Microservices and Event Streaming.   
  Microservices are pretty ubiquitous these days. Really “SOA done right,” they reimagine the services pattern in the context of the world we live in today, nearly two decades since the first big service-oriented systems hit production. But what have we learned in this time?    
  Ben Stopford explore the event-driven paradigm and how it relates to the microservice architectures we build today. Ben dives deep into coupling, evolution and challenges of our increasingly data-oriented culture. He also talks about the future, where data are events and events are data, and touches on real-time architectures that retain the decoupling properties needed to be pluggable, and to evolve.

A software renaissance of some sort is taking place with regard to the authoring of concurrent programs: tying task lifetime to lexical scopes and the stack in a deliberate way while providing sane error propagation and cancellation semantics.
